# README: Diabetic Data Dataset

## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains clinical and demographic information about patients with diabetes who were admitted to hospitals across different time periods. The primary objective of this dataset is to analyze the factors influencing **hospital readmission** of diabetic patients within specific timeframes (less than 30 days, more than 30 days, or no readmission).

This dataset is one of the most comprehensive and widely used datasets in the field of **Medical Machine Learning** and **Healthcare Analytics**. It is commonly used for binary or multi-class classification problems related to predicting hospital readmission.

## Dataset Objectives

1. **Predict hospital readmission** of diabetic patients within different timeframes
2. **Analyze factors influencing patient return** to the hospital
3. **Examine the impact of diabetes medications** on readmission rates
4. **Compare demographic and clinical characteristics** of readmitted vs. non-readmitted patients
5. **Application in Machine Learning and Medical Data Mining research**

## Target Variable: `readmitted`

The target variable in this dataset is the `readmitted` column, which takes three values:

| Value | Description                         | Approximate Percentage |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `NO`  | Patient was not readmitted          | ~54%                   |
| `>30` | Readmitted after 30 days            | ~35%                   |
| `<30` | Readmitted within less than 30 days | ~11%                   |

> **Note:** This dataset has Class Imbalance, which must be addressed during the modeling process.
